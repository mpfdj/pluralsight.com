# Generics
The difference is that the inputs to formal parameters are values, while the inputs to type parameters are types.


# Raw types
A raw type is the name of a generic class or interface without any type arguments. 


# Generic Methods
Generic methods are methods that introduce their own type parameters. The type parameter's scope is limited to the method where it is declared.
The syntax for a generic method includes a list of type parameters, inside angle brackets, which appears before the method's return type.


# Bounded Type Parameters
There may be times when you want to restrict the types that can be used as type arguments in a parameterized type
